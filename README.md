Export GitHub Issues/PRs to Markdown
====================================

This is a script to export GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to Markdown. It is used to preserve discussions more permanently into a Git repository where it then can also be properly linked to.

Thanks [@reberhardt7] for publishing the [initial version] I could base my code on. That saved a lot of work.
